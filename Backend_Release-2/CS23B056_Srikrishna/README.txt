README:

The backend APIs are running online. So we can directly test them and use them in front end application. 

For example, to register a new user, please use

POST https://animimic.onrender.com/api/register

Request body sample for new user registration:

{
    "name":"Ramesh Jindal",
    "mobile": "9840690988",
    "username": "rameshj",
    "email":"ramesh.jindal@gmail.com",
    "password":"ramesh90"
}

For list of API for user management and blog management, please refer to the "Backend_API_DETAILS_V1.0.docx" file.

To compile the code and test in local machine, please use: node app.js in the command prompt of the directory where the source codes are copied.
